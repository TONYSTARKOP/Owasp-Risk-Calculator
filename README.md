# OWASP Risk Calculator

## Overview

The OWASP Risk Calculator is a Python application designed to assess risk levels based on the OWASP Risk Calculation methodology. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and visualizes risk scores using Matplotlib. It allows users to evaluate risk by selecting different factors and provides a color-coded bar chart to represent the risk levels.

## Features

- User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive interface using Tkinter with dropdown menus for selecting risk factors.
- Risk Calculation: Computes total risk and average risk scores based on user inputs.
- Visualization: Displays risk scores in a bar chart with color coding to indicate the severity of risk.
- Risk Levels:
  - Green: Low Risk
  - Yellow: Moderate Risk
  - Orange: High Risk
  - Red: Critical Risk

## Installation

To get started with the OWASP Risk Calculator, follow these steps:


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd owasp-risk-calculator
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   The project depends on the following Python packages:
   - `matplotlib` for plotting
   - `tkinter` for the GUI (usually included with Python)

   Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python risk_calculator.py
   ```

2. **Select Risk Factors**: Use the dropdown menus to choose values for various risk factors, including Threat Agent Factors, Vulnerability Factors, and Technical Impact Factors.

3. **Calculate Risk**: Click the "Calculate Risk" button to compute the total and average risk scores. The application will then display a bar chart showing the risk levels.

## Example

Here's an example of how the risk levels are determined:

- **Total Risk**: Sum of all selected factor scores.
- **Average Risk**: Average score of all selected factors.
- **Color Coding**:
  - **Green**: Total Risk ≤ 4
  - **Yellow**: 4 < Total Risk ≤ 8
  - **Orange**: 8 < Total Risk ≤ 12
  - **Red**: Total Risk > 12
